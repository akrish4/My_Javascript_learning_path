# JavaScript Basics
 - This program displays the text "Hello from JavaScript!" in the console, a zone displaying textual information available in most JavaScript environments, such as browsers.
 -  To achieve this, it uses a JavaScript command named console.log(), whose role is to display a piece of information. The text to be displayed is placed between parentheses and followed by a semicolon, which marks the end of the line.
  - Displaying a text on the screen (the famous Hello World all programmers know) is often the first thing you’ll do when you learn a new programming language. It’s the classic example.
