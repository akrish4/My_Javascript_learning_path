# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is one of the most used programming languages. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995, and it took him ten days. You read it right: JavaScript was really developed in just ten days!

# JavaScript Basics
 - This program displays the text "Hello from JavaScript!" in the console, a zone displaying textual information available in most JavaScript environments, such as browsers.
 -  To achieve this, it uses a JavaScript command named console.log(), whose role is to display a piece of information. The text to be displayed is placed between parentheses and followed by a semicolon, which marks the end of the line.
  - Displaying a text on the screen (the famous Hello World all programmers know) is often the first thing you’ll do when you learn a new programming language. It’s the classic example.
