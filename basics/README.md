# What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript (JS) is one of the most used programming languages. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995, and it took him ten days. You read it right: JavaScript was really developed in just ten days!

- According to GitHub 2018, JS tops the list of the most popular programming languages. It is used for both front-end and back-end development.
```
JavaScript is not Java. These are different programming languages. Their similar names were a marketing move to draw attention to the new language and take advantage of the popularity of Java.

# JavaScript Basics
 - This program displays the text "Hello from JavaScript!" in the console, a zone displaying textual information available in most JavaScript environments, such as browsers.
 -  To achieve this, it uses a JavaScript command named console.log(), whose role is to display a piece of information. The text to be displayed is placed between parentheses and followed by a semicolon, which marks the end of the line.
  - Displaying a text on the screen (the famous Hello World all programmers know) is often the first thing you’ll do when you learn a new programming language. It’s the classic example.
