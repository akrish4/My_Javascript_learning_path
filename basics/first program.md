# The first program 
Programs written in this language are called scripts. Here is an example of a simple JS script that prints Hello, World!:

```
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
All modern browsers have a built-in program that allows you to execute JS directly in them. Let's look at the result of our first program in the browser. 
To do this, press Ctrl+Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Opt+J/Cmd+Option+C on Mac, write the JS code in the opened console, then press Enter.


The result of our first script was the line Hello, World!.

The browser console is not always easy to use, so you can also run this code on online editors.

# Explanation
Here `console.log` is a function. A function is a block of code that performs useful work for you, such as printing text. In a way, a function is a subroutine that can be reused in your programs. When a function name is followed by parentheses, it means that it has been called to get the result. console.log allows you to output information to the console, so this function is often used to find errors in the code.

Moving on: `"Hello, World!"` is a string. All strings in JavaScript are enclosed in single or double quotes, so `'Hello, World!'` would also be a valid string. See for yourself â€“ try to run the following code:

```
console.log('JavaScript');
``` 
This program will print:

```
JavaScript
```
