# The first program 
Programs written in this language are called scripts. Here is an example of a simple JS script that prints I am starting to learn JavaScript!:

```
console.log("I am starting to learn JavaScript!");
```
All modern browsers have a built-in program that allows you to execute JS directly in them. Let's look at the result of our first program in the browser. 
To do this, press Ctrl+Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Opt+J/Cmd+Option+C on Mac, write the JS code in the opened console, then press Enter.

As you can see, the result of our first script was the line I am starting to learn JavaScript!.

The browser console is not always easy to use, so you can also run this code on online editors.
