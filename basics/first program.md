# The first program 
Programs written in this language are called scripts. Here is an example of a simple JS script that prints Hello, World!:

```
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
All modern browsers have a built-in program that allows you to execute JS directly in them. Let's look at the result of our first program in the browser. 
To do this, press Ctrl+Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Opt+J/Cmd+Option+C on Mac, write the JS code in the opened console, then press Enter.


The result of our first script was the line Hello, World!.

The browser console is not always easy to use, so you can also run this code on online editors.
